        Your cells are the green #'s.  Don't lose all of them or you'll lose the game.  Your cells follow your @ sign (moved with WASD keys) and respond to special commands (keys are shown in the in-game ui).

        The CellDOM world is a tile based grid.  Every turn, cells decide on a tile to move to.  If a cell moves into a tile that another cell occupies, it will infect that cell and override its behavior.
